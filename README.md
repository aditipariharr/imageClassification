# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Dataset using CNN and Pre-trained Models

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images from the popular **CIFAR-10 dataset** using multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.  
We train, evaluate, and compare different models including a custom CNN, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2, demonstrating the power of transfer learning and deep learning techniques.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes of small images)
   - Data normalization (values scaled to [0, 1])
   - One-hot encoding for categorical labels

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Display sample images from training data with class labels
   - Visualize a grid of images and their respective labels

3. **Model Architectures**  
   - **Custom CNN**: Three convolutional layers followed by dense layers  
   - **ResNet50-based Model**: Transfer learning with ResNet50 as a feature extractor  
   - **MobileNetV2-based Model**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor

4. **Training Strategy**  
   - Early stopping based on validation loss
   - Adam and SGD optimizers
   - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
   - Batch normalization for better convergence

5. **Performance Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-score  
   All computed for each model and compared in a results table

6. **Visualization of Training Process**  
   - Plot training & validation accuracy and loss curves over epochs

7. **Predictions Visualization**  
   - Display sample test images with predicted labels
